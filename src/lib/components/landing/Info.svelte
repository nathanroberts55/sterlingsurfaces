		<p class="my-1">
			Power washing, also known as pressure washing, is a cleaning method that uses high-pressure
			water spray to remove dirt, grime, mold, and other contaminants from surfaces such as
			buildings, decks, driveways, and sidewalks. The process involves a specialized machine that
			pumps water at high pressure through a hose and nozzle, effectively loosening and washing away
			stubborn debris. Power washing is highly effective for deep cleaning exterior surfaces and
			restoring their original appearance.
